The repository contains the source code for the printf function, along with a set of test cases to verify its correctness. The code is written in C and is designed to be compatible with both Windows and Unix-like systems.
It's important to note that this implementation of printf may not be suitable for all purposes, and may have certain limitations or bugs that are not present in other implementations. It's always a good idea to thoroughly test any code before using it in a production environment.
